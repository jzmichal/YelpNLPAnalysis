# NLP Analysis into what makes a Yelp Restaurant Review Useful

The goal of this project is to gain insight into what makes a yelp restaurant review useful based off of the text.
Given that there are many different flavors of useful reviews, we're going to try and extract the commonalities that
fruitful reviews share in hopes of eventually creating a model that predicts whether or not a user's review will be useful.
